The project is spreaded across 3 phases. 
Phase1:Extreme Point Calculation of a function 
Phase2:Optimization of Multivariable Function 
Phase3:Optimization of Constraint Objective function By Steepest descent Method. 
The programe developed in phase1 and phase2 are utilized in solving the problem statement of phase3.
